# Nice to meet you, my name is Eduardo Arantes. ðŸ‘‹

## Intro

I will summarize below how I got here.

It all started in 2010, when I ended up entering the IT area by chance, in a vacancy that came up in the first company I worked for and I stayed there for 3 years as an IT assistant. To start in the area of â€‹â€‹hardware and infrastructure, I only took short courses in computer and network maintenance, always focused on traditional hardware and infrastructure at the time.

As I always really liked the exact area, and at the time my dream was to open my company in the area of â€‹â€‹providing financial and auditing services, in 2011 I started my degree in administration and intended to later specialize in some area.

In 2013 I ended up leaving that company to take over the IT coordination of another company, where I still work today, providing services.

During the 10 years I worked at this company I ended up taking some courses in the area of â€‹â€‹costs, flow and cash, etc. And today I dedicate 3 days a month to preparing the monthly Results Analysis, and report to the Board, but only as an extra, as my focus is IT.

My plans have always been to leave the IT area, until I have contact with programming logic in 2022, as until then I have always worked with Infra. When I had my contact with logic, and I always liked logical reasoning, I decided in the following semester to start a new degree in Computer Science, and so it was, I started in 2022. Since then I have been totally focused on my studies, and I love learning new things and to study. Everything is still very new and interesting to me.

I have basic English and I'm taking a course to improve it and become fluent.

I never tire of learning, I love studying, and that's why, along with my degree, I take some other courses in the area.
